# adaptivebufferD_RL
a simple to read adaptive de-jitter buffer algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, the only deep learning library used is numpy 
as i was trying to fully understand what goes under the hood in the neural net.
This code was inspired by the post on deep reinforcement learning by Andrej Karpathy , as for the method , i used the policy gradient approache. 
if you have any questions , need clarifications or found a bug , Please feel free to contact me at any time .
